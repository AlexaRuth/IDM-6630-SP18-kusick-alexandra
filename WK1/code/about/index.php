      <h3>Hello Hoomans!</h3>
      <p>I had a ruff start at life after being abandoned at WalMart, when I was rescued I spent the first couple weeks at the vet battling Parvo. I spent a while in foster care and the young boy there gave me the name Rosie Fox and he named my sisters Friend and Slide. No one really knows what breed I am but my hoomans speculate I am an Australian Shepard mix. </p>

      <p>I was adopted a few months later by a the humans Josh and Alex, they are ok. They decided to renamed me to Cora Rose Fox to give me a proper name. I am four years young, and hope to stay around for as long as possible. </p>

      <h3> MY LOVES</h3> 
      <p>My favorite place to be is at DAYCARE, I absolutely go NUTZ when we arrive. My favorite toys are Rope Balls and giant Nyla Bones. I am not great at catching anything my coordination is pretty terrible. I love running and chasing pretty much everything. I love the words Walk, Out, Pee, Food, Paw, DayCare and High Five.</p>

      <h3>MY FEARS</h3>
      <p>I really hate when my humans leave me alone all day, sometimes I throw a tantrum to trick them into taking me with them… I dislike big black coats, and people who walk funny on the street. I hate skateboards and really really do not like one particular pooch in my building. I know everytime whitey with the big hot pink colar is going out for a walk or to do her business. I don’t really care about everyone else they seem okay.</p>
